# Predicting Fuel Efficiency

Demonstrates a machine learning model to estimate fuel efficiency of a car given car's engine specifications. This project is an assignment deliverable of online course _[Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod)_ in Coursera by Brian Caffo et. al.

## Viewing the Assignment

The run-time for the assignment can be viewed from the following links:

 - [WebApp on ShinyApps](http://adib.shinyapps.io/devdataprod-012_01) – the Shiny-based web application.
 - [Slideware on Github](http://adib.github.io/coursera_devdataprod-012_01/Presentation/Presentation.html) or [on RPubs](http://rpubs.com/adib/devdataprod-012_01) – The R Presentation pitch.

## Folder Structure

This repository is divided into three mini-projects:

 - Folder `Presentation` is the _pitch_ part of the assignment that describes the underlying idea for the application and containing a link to the corresponding web application.
 - Folder `WebApp` contains the source files for the web application that runs the model and makes it accessible through a web browser.
 - Folder `Research` contains the various tidbits of R code used to develop the idea and machine learning model.
